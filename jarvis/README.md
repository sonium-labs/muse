# Jarvis

## Overview
Jarvis is a hacky script that will listen to your voice and send music bot commands in a Discord window of your choosing.

Get a key from [here]([url](https://console.picovoice.ai/signup)) and create a new file called `.env` in the `jarvis` directory after you clone, with contents like so:

`PORCUPINE_KEY="<YOUR-KEY-HERE>"`

## Setup
`pip install pynput pyaudio vosk pvporcupine pyttsx3 numpy`

By default, put Discord on your second monitor, justified to the right so the text box is on the lower-right (told you this was hacky). I use this bot in a voice channel so the textbox is in the bottom right by default, but if your text box is somewhere else (or on a different monitor), update the config section at the top of `jarvis.py`.

## Usage
`python jarvis.py`

Then say: _"Jarvis, play hampster dance"_ (should use your default audio input) and it will type `/play [tab] hampster dance` in your Discord window! Works with other common commands too:
